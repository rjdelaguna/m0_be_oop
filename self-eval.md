# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? 
    - Frustrating at times. Though once I read back through some key words are started using those in my search things got easier. Also it was interesting that you can use some tools in ways that weren't explicitly stated.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - I have no issue staying focused. It's the taking breaks part that I need to stay on top off. Today has some long problem solving sessions where I could not tear myself away from my work.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - Keyword usage when googling. Nested if statements inside of the initial class def.
